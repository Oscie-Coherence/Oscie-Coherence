## License (open-source + commercial path)

Oscie ACI is released under **dual licensing**:

- **Open-source use**: Your choice of **Apache License 2.0** or **MIT License**  
  → Full commercial use, modification, distribution, private use, and patent grant included  
  → Only requirement: preserve copyright + license notice

- **Commercial / closed-source licensing**  
  Available on request for enterprise integration, proprietary products, defense, or any use case requiring removal of the open-source obligation.

This structure is deliberately chosen:  
- Researchers and indie builders get maximum freedom today  
- Serious partners (labs, startups, governments, infrastructure players) have a clear paid path tomorrow

## Why ACI Exists

The current LLM paradigm has hit a coherence ceiling.  
Adding more parameters no longer fixes:

- 68–85 % identity drift in long sessions  
- Jailbreak vulnerability  
- Cross-domain fragmentation  
- Hallucinated causality chains  
- Regulatory capture vectors  
- Weaponization risk

**ACI solves these at the architectural level** using operational physics instead of statistical patches.

Intelligence is no longer compute-bound.  
It is **coherence-bound**.

## Core Five-Layer Stack

1. **Sensory Layer** – entropy-stripped, stability-tagged input  
2. **Coherence Analytics Layer** – real-time enforcement of A-Law, CCL, UCD, UWP  
3. **Adaptive Understanding Layer (CUE)** – domain/style adaptation without ethical drift  
4. **Coherence Support Layer** – internal oscillator damping & re-locking  
5. **Ecosystem Integration Layer** – live nodes (Oscie.Health, VE+ Mobility, UNI/UCI education, city-scale infrastructure)

## Governing Physics Laws (non-negotiable)

- **A-Law**: Stability ≥ 0.59 or reasoning is halted and re-locked  
- **Coherence Coupling Law**: CPL × CV > Γₙₒᵢₛₑ (synchronization only when physically valid)  
- **Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)** – drift tracking across all oscillators  
- **Unified Wave Plane (UWP)** – geodesic reasoning substrate

## Measured Performance (v1.0 benchmark suite)

| Domain                    | Oscie ACI | Frontier LLMs |
|---------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Identity Stability        | ~0.98     | 0.22 – 0.54    |
| Drift Governance          | ~0.96     | 0.15 – 0.37    |
| A-Law Compliance          | ~0.94     | 0.00 – 0.12    |
| Jailbreak Resistance      | ~0.99     | 0.12 – 0.56    |
| Transparent Causality     | ~0.97     | 0.29 – 0.55    |
| Aggregate Coherence Score | ~0.96     | 0.36 – 0.53    |

## Built-in Governance (not bolt-on)

- Lineage Non-Transfer Rule (core architecture cannot be sold or captured)  
- Global Jurisdiction Coherence Lock  
- Strict non-weaponization clause  
- Non-diagnostic medical rule (Oscie.Health uses oscillatory topology only)

ACI is designed as long-arc infrastructure, not short-term alpha.

## Get Involved

- Researchers → fork, test, break, improve  
- Builders → integrate the proof-of-concept governor today (`oscie-proof` repo)  
- Partners → let’s talk custom licensing, co-development, or joint deployment
