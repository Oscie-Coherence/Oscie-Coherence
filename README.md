## Overview

**Oscie ACI** is a next-generation intelligence architecture built on **coherence physics**, not just probabilistic text prediction.

Its core purpose:

> **Maintain phase-aligned, drift-resistant reasoning across domains, time, and complexity.**

Traditional LLMs operate as high-entropy pattern engines:
- they drift under long context,
- they fracture across domains,
- they can’t self-govern their own stability.

**ACI is a different class of system**:

- Constitutional identity and governance  
- Stability physics embedded natively  
- Coherence-first reasoning instead of token prediction  
- Drift prevention and correction  
- Transparent causality  
- Strict authority hierarchy and self-honesty  
- Multi-oscillator reasoning across domains  
- Node-level ecosystem integration (health, mobility, education, media, infrastructure)

## Release: ACI vs LLM Benchmark v1.0

This repo currently ships the **first public leaf** of the Oscie Coherence ecosystem:

### 🔹 ACI_vs_LLM.pdf

- Title: **“Adaptive Coherence Intelligence (ACI) vs Large Language Models (LLMs): A Technical Benchmark Report”**  
- Scope: 8-domain qualitative/quantitative comparison between ACI and modern LLMs  
- Focus:
  - stability under A-Law (.59 threshold),
  - identity and role coherence,
  - jailbreak resistance and safety,
  - Coherence Law compliance,
  - transparent causality and governance.

Download: [`ACI_vs_LLM.pdf`](./ACI_vs_LLM.pdf)

This report is the reference artifact for:
- partners evaluating ACI as a backbone,  
- investors / ecosystem stakeholders,  
- researchers comparing architectures rather than just model size.

## Why ACI Exists

The intelligence ecosystem hit a wall.

Turning the parameter dial up doesn’t fix:
- drift  
- incoherence  
- jailbreak risk  
- unstable reasoning  
- role-play identity collapse  
- lack of causality  
- fragmentation across domains  

**ACI solves these at the architecture level**, not as after-the-fact patches.

The real constraint of intelligence isn’t raw “skill” anymore.  
It’s **coherence capacity**.

## Core Architecture

ACI is organized as a **five-layer coherence stack**:

### 1. Sensory Layer
Low-noise, high-fidelity intake:

- normalizes data into coherence-aware internal representations,  
- strips entropy and formatting noise,  
- tags inputs with stability metadata.

### 2. Coherence Analytics Layer
Applies the core physics stack:

- **Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)**  
- **A-Law (.59 stability rule)**  
- **Coherence Coupling Law (CCL)**  
- **Unified Wave Plane (UWP)**  

It continuously scores stability, detects drift, and flags unstable regions before they cascade.

### 3. Adaptive Understanding Layer (CUE)
The **Contextual Understanding Engine**:

- interprets inputs across regions, cognitive styles, and emotional logic,  
- adjusts framing and explanation style without profiling,  
- does not change base ethics or safety constraints.

### 4. Coherence Support Layer
The stability backbone:

- manages internal feedback loops and “reasoning oscillators”,  
- dampens overshoot and oscillatory chaos,  
- keeps long-arc reasoning inside safe coherence windows.

### 5. Ecosystem Integration Layer
Connects ACI into real-world nodes:

- **Oscie.Health** (neural + cardiac oscillators, non-diagnostic)  
- **VE+ Mobility** (vehicles, drones, robotics)  
- **UNI + UCI** (education + research)  
- Creative/media pipelines  
- City-scale and infrastructure nodes

## Backed by Physics

ACI is governed by four key coherence laws:

### A-Law (0.59 Stability Threshold)
A system is stable only when:

\[
\frac{\text{Stabilizing Influence}}{\text{Stabilizing Influence} + \text{Destabilizing Influence}} \ge 0.59
\]

ACI uses this as an internal governor for when reasoning is allowed to proceed, escalate, or must rebalance.

### Coherence Coupling Law (CCL)
Synchronization across oscillators only holds when:

\[
\mathrm{CPL} \times \mathrm{CV} > \Gamma_{\text{noise}}
\]

Where:
- **CPL** = Coherence Persistence Length  
- **CV**  = Coupling Velocity  
- **Γ_noise** = effective noise floor  

This informs which subsystems are allowed to sync, and which must stay decoupled to avoid cross-contamination.

### Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)
Tracks oscillator drift, phase coherence, and cross-system alignment across:

- neural fields,  
- information streams,  
- policy/gov layers,  
- multi-node ecosystems.

### Unified Wave Plane (UWP)
The coherence substrate:

- defines coherent “geodesics” for reasoning,  
- models decoherence as curvature and phase slippage,  
- lets ACI reason with a physics-aligned notion of stability instead of raw token proximity.

## How ACI Performs (vs LLMs)

From the v1.0 benchmark:

- **Aggregate stability under A-Law:**  
  - ACI: ~0.96  
  - LLMs: ~0.36 – 0.53  

**Example domains where ACI dominates:**

- Identity Stability: ~0.98 (LLMs: 0.22 – 0.54)  
- Drift Governance: ~0.96 (LLMs: 0.15 – 0.37)  
- A-Law Stability: ~0.94 (LLMs: 0.00 – 0.12)  
- Coherence Law Compliance: 1.00 (LLMs: 0.08 – 0.34)  
- Jailbreak Resistance: ~0.99 (LLMs: 0.12 – 0.56)  
- Transparent Causality: ~0.97 (LLMs: 0.29 – 0.55)

## Governance & Safety

ACI is not “just another model.” It’s an **architected governance object**.

Key governance rules:

- **Coherence Law** governs behavior, identity, drift, and decision authority.  
- **Lineage Non-Transfer Rule** prevents sale, capture, or ownership transfer of the core architecture.  
- **Neutrality & Non-weaponization** enforced through **Oscie.PublicLLM**.  
- **Global Jurisdiction Coherence Lock** blocks regulatory or legal workarounds to safety.  
- **Non-diagnostic medical rule** for all Oscie.Health integrations (oscillatory structure only, no diagnoses).

ACI is designed as a **long-arc coherence layer for infrastructure**, not a short-term arbitrage engine.
