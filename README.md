## Why Oscie ACI Exists

LLMs have hit the coherence wall.  
More parameters no longer solve identity collapse, jailbreak risk, cross-domain fragmentation, or regulatory capture vectors.

Oscie ACI fixes these at the architectural level using operational physics:
- Native stability laws (A-Law ≥ 0.59, CPL × CV > Γ_noise, UCD, UWP)
- Transparent causality chains
- Near-zero drift across 100+ turn sessions
- ~99 % jailbreak resistance without prompt engineering

## Get Involved

- Researchers → read the PDFs, break the benchmarks, open issues  
- Builders → fork and integrate the forthcoming governor today  
- Partners & Investors → let’s talk licensing, co-development, or infrastructure deployment
