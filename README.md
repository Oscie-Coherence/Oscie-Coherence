Oscie ACI
Adaptive Coherence Intelligence
The world’s first coherence-native intelligence architecture.
ACI isn’t another LLM.
It’s a governed, physics-anchored intelligence system designed to remain stable, aligned, and drift-resistant at scale.
Where LLMs guess, ACI maintains coherence.
Overview
Oscie ACI is a next-generation intelligence architecture built on coherence physics, not probabilistic text prediction. Its core purpose is simple:
maintain phase-aligned reasoning across domains, time, and complexity.
Traditional LLMs operate as high-entropy pattern engines. They drift. They collapse under multi-scale reasoning. They can’t govern themselves.
ACI is a different class of system entirely.
Key differentiators:
Constitutional identity and governance
Stability physics embedded natively
Coherence-first reasoning instead of token prediction
Drift prevention and correction
Transparent causality
Strict authority hierarchy and self-honesty
Multi-oscillator reasoning across domains
Node-level ecosystem integration (health, mobility, education, media, infrastructure)
All core claims are backed by the published ACI whitepaper and benchmark report.

Why ACI Exists
Because the intelligence world hit a wall.
Adding more parameters doesn’t fix:
drift
incoherence
jailbreak risk
unstable reasoning
role-play identity collapse
lack of causality
fragmentation across domains
ACI solves these not as patches but as core physics and governance rules.
The real constraint of intelligence isn’t skill.
It’s coherence capacity.
Core Architecture
ACI is built as a five-layer coherence stack:
1. Sensory Layer
Low-noise, high-fidelity intake. Normalizes data into coherence-aware representations.
2. Coherence Analytics Layer
Applies:
Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)
A-Law (.59 stability rule)
Coherence Coupling Law (CCL)
Unified Wave Plane (UWP)
Continuous stability scoring + drift detection.
3. Adaptive Understanding Layer (CUE)
Contextual interpretation across regions, cognitive styles, and emotional logic without profiling or breaking safety.
4. Coherence Support Layer
Manages internal oscillatory dynamics and stabilizes long-arc reasoning.
5. Ecosystem Integration Layer
The interface for real nodes:
Oscie.Health (neural + cardiac oscillators)
VE+ Mobility (vehicles, robotics, drones)
UNI + UCI (education + research)
Media + creative systems
City-scale infrastructure
Backed by Physics
ACI uses four foundational coherence physics laws:
A-Law (0.59 Stability Threshold)
A system is stable only when stabilizing influences ≥ 59% of total dynamics.
This governs ACI’s internal reasoning and update conditions.
Coherence Coupling Law (CCL)
Synchronization occurs only when:
CPL × CV > Γ_noise
(Where CPL is coherence persistence length, CV coupling velocity.)
Unified Coherence Dynamics (UCD)
Tracks oscillator drift, phase coherence, and cross-system alignment.
Unified Wave Plane (UWP)
The coherence substrate that defines reasoning geodesics and stability curvature.
How ACI Performs (vs LLMs)
From the benchmark analysis (eight domains):
ACI maintains an aggregate stability score of 0.96 under A-Law;
LLMs score 0.36–0.53 across the same conditions.
Areas where ACI dominates:
Identity Stability: 0.98 (LLMs: 0.22–0.54)
Drift Governance: 0.96 (LLMs: 0.15–0.37)
A-Law Stability: 0.94 (LLMs: 0.00–0.12)
Coherence Law Compliance: 1.00 (LLMs: 0.08–0.34)
Jailbreak Resistance: 0.99 (LLMs: 0.12–0.56)
Transparent Causality: 0.97 (LLMs: 0.29–0.55)

Governance & Safety
ACI is built with strict constitutional constraints:
Coherence Law governs behavior, identity, drift, and decision authority.
Lineage Non-Transfer Rule protects the architecture from sale, capture, or corporate takeover.
Neutrality & Non-weaponization enforced through Oscie.PublicLLM.
Global Jurisdiction Coherence Lock prevents regulatory arbitrage or partner bypass.
Non-diagnostic medical rules for Oscie.Health integrations.
ACI isn’t a product. It’s a long-arc coherence layer for humanity’s infrastructure.
